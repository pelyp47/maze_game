# Player's Guide

## Log-in

Open the game's page (for the local installation click [here](http://localhost:5173/)). Click the `log in` button, then click `log in with Auth0`, then populate the form (you will need to choose the name which hasn't been taken yet).

## Create the game

Click `create your own` and wait for somebody to join. You will become a Player 1 in that case.

## Join the game

Click `join game` in the table shown on the screen. You will become a Player 2 if you joined the already created game.

## Playing the game

You can only move when it is your turn (see the indicator above the chat). Navigate the maze with arrow keys or by sending the `/left` | `/right` | `/up` | `/down` commands to the chat. Try to reach the maze exit (`->`) faster than your opponent. You can communicate with your opponent using the chat regardless of whether it is your turn or not at the moment (but movement commands works only during your turn).

## Extra tips

- black squares are walls
- dot inside a square indicates that you already visited this maze cell
- the win/lose message will appear in chat after one of players have reached the exit of the maze
- the chat can be used even after the game has ended
